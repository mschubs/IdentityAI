    "quote": "I joined Helping Hands because I wanted to be apart of an amazing movement and positively impact the lives of as many children as I can. I firmly believe that Helping Hands allows me to do so because it is an organization dedicated to giving underprivileged children the education they deserve and that will allow them to flourish. Through my participation in Helping Hands, I aim to inspire children to become avid thinkers and give them the education to do so. I hope we can create a generation of students empowered by knowledge and eager to help the world."
